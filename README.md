# Fake Arabic reviews detection for ABSA (Aspect-based sentiment analysis) in the hospitality industry  
### This is my end of 4th year project  
We used self-training which is a semi-supervised learning technique that iteratively trains a classifier on a small labeled dataset, and then uses the trained classifier to label a larger unlabeled dataset, and adds the high-confidence labeled examples to the labeled dataset. This process is repeated for several iterations, until the performance of the classifier on the labeled dataset stops improving.
